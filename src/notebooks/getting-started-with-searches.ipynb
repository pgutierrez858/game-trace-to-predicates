    "### MCTS-based searches\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```BasicMCTSSearch.kt``` class defines a search method that makes use of a simplified MCTS algorithm to look for predicates that optimize the value of the given evaluation function. Internally, this class defines the search problem as a single-player game where the state (```GrammarProductionState.kt```) corresponds to a list of symbols derived from the search grammar, some of which are terminal (i.e. cannot be expanded any further), some not. These latter non-terminal symbols are associated with grammar rules and can thus be expanded in all the different ways that their rule allows.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we were to use the ```ifThenGrammar.bnf``` as our search grammar, given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<expr> ::=  G(!( <literal> ) \"|\" ( <literal> )) | G(!( <literal> ) \"|\" F ( <literal> )) | ( <expr> ) & ( <expr> )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "the initial game state would be ```<expr>```, which consists of a single non-terminal symbol that can be expanded in 3 different ways following the productions of its grammar rule. Each of these production choices is treated as a game action when performing MCTS, and leads to a successor state where the expanded symbol is replaced by the ones of the chosen production. For instance, if we take the action that expands ```<expr> ::= ( <expr> ) & ( <expr> )```, the new game state would simply be represented by ```( <expr> ) & ( <expr> )```, and now we would have a total of 6 possible actions to take from there: 3 for each of the ```<expr>``` symbols added to the base expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's replicate this behavior by manually declaring an initial grammar production state from the ```<expr>``` symbol and the ```ifThenGrammar.bnf``` grammar, and then observing how the state representation and possible actions evolve when following the steps from the description above. "
